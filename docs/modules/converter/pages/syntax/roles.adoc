= Specific roles

Roles are usually applied with the following syntax where the `important-text` CSS class would be applied to the slide title in the generated HTML:

[source, asciidoc]
....
[.important-text]
== Slide Title

* Some
* Information
....

Or

[source, asciidoc]
....
[role="important-text"]
== Slide Title

* Some
* Information
....

See https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#role[Asciidoctor's documentation] for more details.

.Image specific note
In addition to the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/\#positioning-attributes[existing attributes] to position images, roles can be used as well. However, the shorthand syntax (.) doesn't work in the image macro arguments but must be used above with the angle bracket syntax.
See {uri-project-examples}/images.adoc[images.adoc] for examples.

Here is a list of supported roles:
