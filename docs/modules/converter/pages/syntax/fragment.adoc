Slide Four has bullets that are revealed one after the other.
This is what `reveal.js` calls {uri-revealjs-home}/fragments[fragments].
Applying the step option or role on a list (`[%step]` or `[.step]`) will do the trick.
Here is {uri-revealjs-doc}#fragments[the relevant reveal.js
documentation] on the topic.
Note that only `fade-in` is supported for lists at the moment.
